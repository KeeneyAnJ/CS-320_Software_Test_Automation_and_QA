- How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
    To ensure that code, program or software is functional and secure It is important to be committed to quality to eliminate defects and future escapements in a released product. By reviewing requirements and specifications during static testing for possible gaps, defects can be eliminated early in the software development life cycle. When Dynamically testing code, JUnit tests can be implemented to validate functional and performance requirements are met. It is also important to eliminate bias while testing code by performing independent testing to ensure quality is met

- How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
    I interpret user requirements during static testing by reviewing functional and technical specifications. I can then analyze user cases and document the expected outputs given different parameters. These can then be implements into unit tests to ensure that user needs are incorporated into the program. 

- How do I approach designing software?
    Prior to this class, I would have reviewed user requirements and designed the software with an iterative method. I would have tested each requirement by using a main function to verify the software produced expected results. Going forward, I will be implementing JUnit testing techniques to test my code rather than modifying and running a main function to test my programs. Using individual test cases will increase efficiency and quality in future work products.
